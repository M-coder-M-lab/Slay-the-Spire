        Slay the Web is a single player card game where you fight monsters to reach the end of the web. It's a
        game of planning and knowing when to play which card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every turn you draw 5 cards from your draw pile. Most cards cost energy to play. Energy is refreshed
        every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards may deal damage to monsters, block enemy attacks or make them weak or vulnerable. They can heal
        you and other things. You'll figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware, whenever you end your turn, the monsters take turn. Above each target you'll get a hint which
        action it will take on it's upcoming turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should you manage to kill the monsters in a room before they end you, you'll proceed to the next room.
        Maybe there will be rewards. Can you reach the end?

            >This game is open source</a

          new cards, monsters or fights.

          You can inspect &mdash; and modify &mdash; pretty much anything in the game using the browser's
          developer tools. This can definitity cause weird and fun behaviours.
